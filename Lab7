Lab 7:

This week, we were asked to keep Wifi APs:

In my neighborhood: 
  123ABC, bunnyhouse, Eagle, Go4Niners, MABrown, Mermaid, Mewerp, Netgear07, Neatgear35, Netgear97, Peters24-PRO,
Popsplace, Salsa de estar.b, XFINITY, Xf08, JBL_Flip3

As for the bonus lab, this weeks bonus content was much more relatable to what I am used to, except for the second to last problem on part 3, which
took me a long time to understand as my computer and the online environment do not seem to like them. The command that I did manage to think up either
did not work, and even though eventually it did, my mac and the online environment hated it. Those problems I am less fond of, since they want me to take
a file my PC can't interact with and try to use my tools on it. I am just glad I was able to go on another device (non-Macbook) to figure it out.
