Pro Dev Final:

General Skills - Obedient Cat: 
  This task was simple, as a file with no extension was downloaded called "flag". Opening it in a text editor revealed 
the answer.

Cryptology - Mod 26: 
  This task wanted me to use an online decoder for Rot13 to put in the correct key.

General Skills - Python Wrangling
  This was the hardest by far. My Macbook does not like anything programming related, declaring it all to be malware. In 
order to get my Computer Science Degree, I had to turn off every security measure and firewall, then install 10+ 
supportive programs and another VSC extensions to keep my IDE afloat at all times. That hardly worked for C++, so 
for python I tried Repl.it. Nothing. I found there was an on-site terminal. Tried that, got an error. Tried my IDE again, 
installed 40 things trying to read it. Nada. Tried to brute force hash the code. Finally, I managed to figure it out 
in the online IDE on PicoCTF. That was very inconvinent and I spent more than a half hour on it.

Forensics - Information:
  This one was odd too. After looking for something that wasn't Linux or Windows only, I tried using a stereogram on the Cat.png. 
Also converted it to a .txt file and found a tag near the top. Converted it from base 64 and made sure it was in the right format 
and it worked.

Web Exploitation - Get ahead:
  The spelling was odd in the title, and I knew based on the category that I should be looking in the inspect element. I saw 
  that there was "Get" and "Post", and then I realized that I'd have to somehow try using the a"HEAD" in the title to try and
force a Head method. After looking into a command that could prompt information from a URL, I found a curl command, and then after
doing curl --help in my terminal, found curl -I. Fumbling with the command a dozen times, I managed to get a message saying "COULD 
NOT RESOLVE HOST HEAD", which made me think I was wrong, until I saw the flag in picoCTF format pop up.

Forensics - Enhance!:
  I have no clue if I did it right, but I changed the .svg file to a .txt, and noticed that all of the tspan tags at the bottom
have a character surrounded by a space. I took them all and made the full flag.

Web Exploitation - Inspect HTML:
  This one about told me what me to do, and in the history lesson, gave me a hint it had to do with the head tag. I inpected element
and found the flag.

Forensics - Lookey Here:
  I saw this one had a txt file of Ayn Rand's Anthem, and I thought that was neat. I opened it as a .txt and used ctrl-F to find a 
flag, which there was.

Cryptography - Morse-Code:
  We were given a wav file.
I tried listening to it twice and managed to get about half the message out, but once I started hearing 5 long tones (0) I got 
very confused since I didn't know numbers were an option. I used FL Studio to look at the waveform and translated it.

Cryptography - Mr-Worldwide:
  This challenge gave me a series of coordinates:
picoCTF{(35.028309, 135.753082)(46.469391, 30.740883)(39.758949, -84.191605)(41.015137, 28.979530)(24.466667, 54.366669)
(3.140853, 101.693207)_(9.005401, 38.763611)(-3.989038, -79.203560)(52.377956, 4.897070)(41.085651, -73.858467)(57.790001, -152.407227)
(31.205753, 29.924526)}
At first, I thought these could be plugged into desmos, but with all the decimals I found out "Worldwide" refers to Latitude and Longitude.
The locations they wanted required me to zoom out to the nearest closest large title, and often times I had to adjust.
