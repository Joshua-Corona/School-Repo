Lab 2:
I guess I am supposed to use these handy in-browser files as the spaces to type my Lab reflection.

During the TryHackMe lab, we went through the basics on how to use THM answers, and once I figured out how to mark the first box as "Complete", 
it dove right into the Open Systems Interconnection Model. I like how each section provided another layer of information that you could read in real-time, 
and so there was a few helpful charts for the OSI model in the first few parts there. 

After a while, a lot of the answers became more application based than just reading and answering. One thing I liked is that this then made us run the whois, 
tracert, and ping strings in our terminals and then get information about the specific webpages and networks from that route. Overall, the lab did not take 
me too long, and it took me longer to figure out what to do here. A lot of the imagery was also very helpful so I could figure out what was going on.
