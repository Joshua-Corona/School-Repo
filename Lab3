During the second TryHackMe lab, we went through the basics of Local Area Networks and parts of an IP address. There were a few animations and Labs within the 
first section that I felt well animated and well described the faults of each network as well as how it worked. This was one thing that I felt was really neat 
about this lab, is that it did a lot more showing than just the read and copy answers from the incuded text, which I was also a fan of.
