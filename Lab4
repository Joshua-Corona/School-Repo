Lab 4: DNS in Detail

During the TryHackMe lab, we went through readings on what DNS was, and an informative video on the topic. Going though the history of how the
Top Level Domains were structured was also helpful, as I had known roughly about the .com/.gov/.edu/.org domains, but not the Country Code Top Level
Domain ones. I actually did take the time to look at the list of over 2000 TLD and had a look at those to get an idea of how broad they could be, and I
was surprised to see Allstate had their very own.

The final portion of the lab was a little confusing, it didn't actually want me to type in "shop.website.thm", but just "shop". Once I figured that out,
the process became easier.
