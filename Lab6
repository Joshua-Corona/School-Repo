Lab 6: Fabrication of Cables

This lab seemed a lot different than what I was used to, but all the content in class seemed to switch over to it without any major confusion. 
On one hand, there was the video that went over maintenance of cables, and then the lab wanted us to simulate cable fabrications. The first one, 
straight, was easy since I just matched the colors straight across with the same color. 

The last one too was fairly easy, roll over, since that was the pattern of colors in reverse. 

The main one that confused me, cross over, I had to look into so I could get a good idea of what the lab wanted me to do. 

Ultimately, the lab was pretty good, there was a small discrepancy with the fact that the lights wouldn't go on if you were wrong, and there was 
a lot of time where I was looking into these fabrications until the simulation outright asked me if I was right. Though not quite TryHackMe level, 
it had been very informative.
