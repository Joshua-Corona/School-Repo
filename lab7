Lab 7:

This week, we were asked to keep Wifi APs:

In my neighborhood: 
  123ABC, bunnyhouse, Eagle, Go4Niners, MABrown, Mermaid, Mewerp, Netgear07, Neatgear35, Netgear97, Peters24-PRO,
Popsplace, Salsa de estar.b, XFINITY, Xf08, JBL_Flip3

As for the bonus lab, this weeks bonus content was much more relatable to what I am used to, except for the second to last problem on part 3, which
took me a long time to understand as my computer and the online environment do not seem to like them
