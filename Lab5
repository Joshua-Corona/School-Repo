Lab 5: Active Reconnaissance

During this lab, I was promped to learn about the traceroute, telnet, and nc commands, as well as some of their pros and flaws.
It also went through the browser, and information that you can learn about a network from the commands above, and through the Internet DevTools.
Throughout the lab, we were asked to find out information of websites and ports using said commands, and this was one of the labs where the hands
on portion got to be a little confusing. There were points where I would try a command, and not understand that it needed me to fill in my own information
(or in one case, follow the example to a T), and so there were commands that though I used right as far as syntax, it wasn't obtaining the right
information. 

One thing that I did like about the lab is their coverage on what Active Reconnaissance is, and why like real life investigating, you can't just 
begin invading all kinds of servers to try to prevent attacks, and there is a lot of delicate paperwork and clearances needed to do the job.
